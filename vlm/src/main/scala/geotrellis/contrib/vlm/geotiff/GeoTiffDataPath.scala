 *    this path can be prefixed with, '''gtiff+''' to signify that the target GeoTiff
 *    is to be read in only by [[GeoTiffRasterSource]].
 *  @example "data/my-data.tiff"

 *  @example "gtiff+file:///tmp/data.tiff"
 *
 *  @param tiffExtensions `List` of extensions to look for when confirming whether or
 *    not the target file is a GeoTiff.
 *  @note Capitalization of the extension is not regarded.
